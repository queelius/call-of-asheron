# The Call of Asheron

**An Epic Fantasy Novel**

*By Alexander Towell*

---

## Synopsis

Four strangers are torn from their world and cast into Dereth—a land where lifestones grant immortality at a terrible price: every death remembered, every agony preserved, accumulating until the mind breaks or transforms into something no longer human.

Thomas, a hunter who watched his family die. Duulak, a scholar carrying guilt for a student he couldn't save. Maajid, a mystic who sees death as cosmic comedy. Marcus, a commander who builds civilization from chaos. Each must choose how far they'll go to survive—and whether survival is worth what it costs.

As an alien hive-mind rises and ancient powers manipulate from the shadows, the four discover they weren't chosen randomly. They are Harbingers, selected to face a threat that has destroyed civilizations before.

*The Call of Asheron* is an epic fantasy exploring forced migration, consciousness, transformation, and what survival demands of those who endure it.
