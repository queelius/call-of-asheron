## High Priority

### Volume Balance (structural, ongoing)

Volume balance remains 76/24 (Vol I vs. Vols II-V). Target was 65/35 but achieving that would require either gutting Vol I's character development or adding ~800 lines of new content to Vols II-V. The Feb 2025 revision expanded three scenes in Vol III and added interstitial scenes to Vols IV-V, reducing the "tonal cliff" without solving the structural ratio. Further approaches:

1. **Thomas's arc: Grim Hunter → Connector** — Needs a dramatized bridging scene in Vol III or IV showing the shift from destruction to empathy. Currently happens offscreen. (from worldsmith review #13)
2. **Maajid's age-voice gap** — His youthful voice ("Don't you see?") disappears too abruptly after transformation. Add occasional flashes of youthful diction in Vols IV-V beyond the cardamom moments. (from worldsmith review #10)
3. **Battle scene pattern variation** (Vol III, Siege of Haven, lines 5568-5678) — Repeating structural pattern (situation/dialogue/action/death/resurrection) 4-5 times. Vary: one cycle could focus on internal experience, another could skip the resurrection. (from worldsmith review #19)

### Remaining Continuity

1. **Maajid death count:** 42 (line 3816 — Elena says "forty-two times") vs. potential discrepancies elsewhere. Timeline doc tracks this.

## Medium Priority

### Worldbuilding Integration (from WORLDBUILDING_DESIGN.md)

These are scene ideas from the worldbuilding doc that haven't been integrated:

1. Crystal responsiveness — Duulak noticing crystals near his workstation have changed
2. Magic style contrast — comparing Gharu'ndim, Aluvian, Sho casting on Dereth
3. The Stillness mission — expedition where death is permanent
4. Religious debate at Haven — Thomas mediating theological arguments
5. Singing Depths exploration — Maajid encountering pre-Empyrean structures
6. Maajid and the Sho monk — connection to traditional contemplative practice
7. The Deep Things reference — Empyrean text about something below the Matriarch

### Voice & Craft Polish

1. **Dialogue length under stress** — Maajid's 12-line speech (~line 4208) and Duulak's analytical crisis dialogue (~line 4326) need breaking with physical interruptions. (from worldsmith review #8)
2. **Virindi speech could be more alien** — Longer communications sound like English sentences rather than concept-transfer. Experiment with non-standard syntax. (from worldsmith review #14)
3. **"The question is" repetition** — 18 instances across all characters. Natural for Duulak, authorial fingerprint in others. (from worldsmith review #23)
4. **Over-qualification in narration** — "Something approaching respect," "something like hope" — narrator hedges too frequently. (from worldsmith review #22)
5. **Khalid's voice underdeveloped** — ~5 dialogue lines, generic diplomatic language. (from worldsmith review #24)
6. **Chapter titles generic in Vols II-IV** — Vol I titles evocative ("The Weight of Knowing"); Vols II-IV functional ("Paths of Power"). (from worldsmith review #26)

## Low Priority / Nice to Have

### Potential Future Development

- Matriarch perspective fragment — brief section showing her perception of the four Harbingers as "four narrow windows into depths she couldn't reach through breadth alone"
- Empyrean ruins revelation — evidence of their own experiments, their version of hybrid horrors
- Network edge experience — character's resurrection goes wrong near the boundary
- Expanded cultural conflict scenes in settlements (theological debates, governance friction)
