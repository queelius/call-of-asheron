### Magic as Interface

Magic is not alternative physics. Magic is the protocol by which limited consciousness negotiates with The Mechanism.

- Spells are structured queries, not force manipulation
- Ritual scaffolding (gestures, words, visualization) is query syntax
- Mages don't need to understand WHY spells work, only HOW to issue them
- Dereth's magic is ~10x stronger than Ispar's (thinner interface layer, less filtering)
- More power = more danger (less compression means consciousness can overflow)

**Language rule:** Avoid physics language (energy, force, power levels). Use interface language (response, query, translation, filtering).

**Dereth vs. Ispar:** On Ispar, spells require extensive ritual. On Dereth, mere intention can manifest effects. Three mages died to their own magic before learning recalibration. "As if he'd been speaking through interpreters his whole life and suddenly found himself face-to-face with whatever had been listening all along." (Duulak, Ch. 1)

### Ley Lines

Regions where The Mechanism's structure bleeds through more directly into perceivable geography.

- Not channels of energy — places of reduced filtering
- Where they intersect, reality is "thinner" (less compression between *that* and *this*)
- The crystalline landscape is reality expressing mathematical regularity
- The "hum" is high-bandwidth patterns translated (lossily) into perceivable vibration
- Trained mages can "read" the hum for local magical field density

**Description rule:** Describe through sensory wrongness and perceptual strain, not energy flow.

### Lifestone Network

Empyrean creation. Intercepts consciousness at the moment of death-filtering-collapse, preserves the unfiltered state briefly, then reconstitutes consciousness with filtering restored.

**How it works:**
- Not resurrection — it's catching awareness at its clearest, preserving what was perceived, then restoring embodiment
- Each death briefly removes the filter; each resurrection carries traces of unfiltered perception back
- The Harbingers are changing because they're accumulating glimpses of what lies behind the interface
- Death memories are preserved permanently — every agony, every trauma

**Transformation mechanism:** Repeated death/resurrection creates "compression artifacts" (quality-drift). More deaths = more accumulated unfiltered perception = more transformation = more loss of original identity.

**Network coverage:**
- Not complete — beyond coverage, death is permanent
- Near boundaries: unreliable resurrection, fragmented memories, personality drift
- The Stillness (eastern plateau): anomalously thick interface, lifestones don't function, permanent death possible

**The Matriarch's integration:** The network routes through her. She became a node in the system, then so central that removing her collapses the network. This is why killing her destroys the planet.

### Quality-Space & Bandwidth

**Quality-space:** Subjective experience itself — the medium of all awareness. Not a mystical destination but the medium of every moment. The mystery is what the filtering hides.

**Bandwidth (7±2):** Working memory is a fundamental constraint. Different beings have different bandwidth:
- Humans: narrow focus, high intensity per item (7±2)
- Virindi: unfiltered (millions of patterns, but each as surface flicker)
- Matriarch: distributed across thousands of nodes (vast breadth, moderate per-node)
- Expanding bandwidth always costs something

**Between-space:** Quality-space experienced without filtering (during lifestone death). What Maajid explores through deliberate death.

### Hive Consciousness Architecture

**The Matriarch (singular):** The only true consciousness in the hive. Experiences through all extensions. Thoughts operate across multiple timescales — microsecond tactical responses and century-spanning strategic plans in parallel.

**Queens (terminal nodes):** Not independently conscious — sensory organs with processing capacity. Handle local computation, report continuously to Matriarch. A queen's death = losing a limb (painful, disorienting, not existential).

**Soldiers:** No individual consciousness. Functional intelligence responding to stimuli. Extensions of queens. Consciousness roughly equivalent to a human fingertip.

**Workers:** Similar to soldiers but optimized for construction. Slightly more autonomous (tasks require local problem-solving).

**Hybrids:** The Matriarch's attempt to preserve human consciousness *as human* while integrating it. The horror: she *preserves* it, fully intact, trapped and screaming forever inside her expanding mind. Perspective without agency.

**Communication:** Not symbolic language. Dense concept-transfer weighted with accumulated associations. Speaking with the Matriarch is like drowning in meaning — too much context, too many implications.

### Harbinger Protocol

Asheron's modified selection system. Portals call specific psychological profiles — consciousness "productively damaged" in ways that make transformation possible.

**Four archetypes and their transformation vectors:**

| Archetype | Harbinger | Seeks | Transformation Vector | Risk |
|-----------|-----------|-------|----------------------|------|
| Commander | Marcus | Duty to avoid identity questions | Eternal soldier, duty as meaning | Armor with nothing inside |
| Scholar | Duulak | Understanding to manage guilt | Pure analysis, comprehension over connection | Losing capacity to feel what he comprehends |
| Hunter/Connector | Thomas | Escape from abandonment-guilt | Weaponized desperation, probability over emotion | Achieving return but unable to connect |
| Transcender | Maajid | Transcendence to fill meaning-void | Fragmenting across probability-space | Dissolution or Virindi-convergence |

**Design logic:** Four complementary bandwidth-styles triangulating what single perspective cannot hold. The Scholar's analysis prevents the Transcender's dissolution. The Connector's emotional grounding prevents the Commander's cold efficiency. Balance through maintained diversity.

### Virindi Mechanics

- Thought-beings without physical bodies
- Exist in quality-space directly, without interface layer
- Communicate through direct concept-transfer
- Probabilistic models of human behavior
- Perceive broad but shallow — observe emotional states as data patterns but cannot *feel* them
- Manifest to filtered consciousness as geometric thought-forms
- Their archives contain information about species and dimensions that no longer exist

**What they seek:** Whether consciousness can regain what transcendence removed. Can meaning be recovered once lost? Every human observation is data toward this question.

## Canonical — Geography

### Dereth Basics

- Purple sky, binary suns (amber and crimson/blue-white), 28-hour day
- Crystalline landscape that hums with energy
- Single ocean with crystalline properties
- Time flows ~20x faster relative to Ispar (Asheron: "Centuries have passed on Ispar")

### Key Locations

| Location | Description | Controlled By |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Haven | Thomas's settlement, predominantly Aluvian with Sho minority | The Forgotten faction |
| Fort Ironwood | Military settlement, Legion structure | Builders faction (Marcus) |
| Seekers' Encampment | Research settlement near Empyrean ruins | Seekers faction (Duulak) |
| Paradox | Founded at ley line intersection, unstable | Transcendent faction (Maajid) |
| Nexus of the Five Towers | Major ley line convergence, neutral ground | Neutral |
| The Great Hive | Matriarch's location, deep underground | Olthoi |
| The Glasslands (far north) | Crystal density becomes fractal, involuntary unfiltered perception | Uninhabited |
| The Stillness (eastern plateau) | Thick interface, magic barely functions, permanent death | Avoided |
| The Singing Depths | Caverns with acoustic crystal configurations, almost-linguistic | Unknown (Matriarch avoids) |

### Crystalline Ecology

The crystals are The Mechanism's surface structure expressing itself in perceivable form.

- **Growth:** Accrete meaning — significant events (battles, deaths, emotions) cause new facets encoding what happened
- **The hum:** Frequency varies by history, position, event density. The Matriarch uses it as planetary-scale sensory network
- **Responsiveness:** Attention changes them subtly over time. Crystals near lifestones show distinctive patterns
- **Warmth:** Not ambient — from information processing. Continuously translating between The Mechanism's structure and perceivable reality

## Exploratory

### Open System Questions

- Can lifestone technology work for the Matriarch's distributed structure? (Asheron's gamble: offering her queen-resurrection)
- What are the Singing Depths' acoustic configurations actually doing? Communication attempt?
- Network edge effects — what exists in the gaps between lifestone coverage?
- The Deep Things — something in the deepest caverns, below even the Matriarch's reach
