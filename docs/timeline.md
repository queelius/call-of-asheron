# Timeline Authority

Chronological reference for *The Call of Asheron*. All dates, durations, and event sequences in this document are drawn directly from manuscript text. When any other document or the manuscript contradicts this timeline on a date or sequence, reconcile against this document first.

**Conventions:**
- "Day 0" = each character's portal crossing onto Dereth (these are not simultaneous)
- Line references are approximate and may shift with manuscript edits; chapter/section names are the stable anchors
- Death counts are cumulative unless marked otherwise
- Time on Ispar passes at ~20:1 ratio to Dereth (revealed Ch "The Ambush," ~line 5787)

## Pre-Portal (Ispar)

Events on Ispar before anyone crosses to Dereth.

| Event | Character | Manuscript Location | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Chromatic Court demonstration disaster | Duulak | Ch 1, "The Scholar's Folly," line ~68-128 | Duulak, age 47, attempts parallel-world observation before the Chromatic Court. Experiment destabilizes; rifts appear. 17 years of prior theorizing mentioned (line 74). 12 years married to Yasmin (line 132). |
| Whirlwinds begin across Ispar | -- | Ch 1, line 68 | "Three weeks before the whirlwinds began appearing across the kingdom" -- places Court demo 3 weeks before visible portals. |
| Duulak's obsessive research period | Duulak | Ch 1, line 145-200 | "Twenty-two days after the Chromatic Court disaster" -- study becomes temple to obsession. Yasmin reports 3 days without sleep (line 165). Korvain (assistant) present. |
| Portal sightings escalate across Ispar | -- | Ch 1, line 152 | Northern Reach sightings; village of Khayyaban vortex (6 hours). |
| Duulak crosses to Dereth | Duulak | Ch 1, line ~200-230 | 22+ days after Court disaster. Portal appears in his study area. Crosses voluntarily to investigate his responsibility. |
| Thomas's portal crossing | Thomas | Ch 3 opening, line ~878 | Age 34. Hunter. On hunting expedition when portal appears. Wife Mara and son William left behind. |
| Maajid's portal crossing | Maajid | Ch 2 opening, line ~381 | Age 17. Portal appears day before entrance examination. Crosses willingly -- "seeking escape" rather than compelled (line 5151). |
| Marcus's portal crossing | Marcus | Ch 4 opening, line ~405 | Age 43. 27 years in the Legion (line 420). Portal appears at Legion training ground after promotion ceremony (line 5151). |

**Portal selection pattern (Duulak's analysis, Ch "The Scholar's Recognition"):** Each portal appeared at a moment of peak psychological vulnerability -- Duulak after guilt, Thomas after decision to provide rather than pursue, Marcus when identity was fully subsumed by duty, Maajid after realizing his seeking led nowhere (lines 5149-5151, 5481).

## Arrival Period (Weeks 1-6)

Individual arcs, parallel chronology. Characters arrive at different times; the manuscript does not specify exact relative offsets between arrivals. Celeste states portals started "three months ago" when Duulak arrives at the Seeker Encampment (line 576), placing early portals ~3 months before that conversation.

### Duulak

| Timeframe | Event | Location | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Day 0 | Arrives on Dereth | Wilderness | Disoriented; "three hours ago. Or perhaps three days" (line 545) -- temporal confusion on arrival. |
| Day ~1-2 | Reaches Seeker Encampment | Seeker Encampment | Celeste greets him. Encampment already established; portals started "three months ago" (line 576). |
| Day 3 | First death | Seeker Encampment | Killed during Olthoi raid (line 684, 859). First resurrection experience. |

### Thomas

| Timeframe | Event | Location | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|

| ~3 weeks (Day 21) | Scouting mission | Near Haven | "Three weeks" into Dereth (line 1316). |
| Day 23 | Temporal marker | Haven area | "Twenty-three days here" (line 1322). |
| Day 37 | Virindi confirm duration | Near Haven | "Thirty-seven days since the portal" (line 1527, 1662). Virindi state "thirty-seven days" (line 1564). |
| Day ~35 (5 days before Day 37 marker) | First Virindi contact | Near Haven | Thomas meets Virindi 5 days after a major attack (line 1519). |
| ~5 weeks (Day 35-37) | Death count: 10 | Haven | "Ten deaths" after 5 weeks (lines 1523-1524). Shelter still temporary at 5 weeks (line 1662). |

### Maajid

| Timeframe | Event | Location | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Day 0 | Arrives on Dereth | Wilderness | Age 17. Crossed willingly. |
| Day 3 | Becomes settlement "problem" | Early settlement | 3 days after arriving (line 2169). |
| ~6 weeks | Settlement period | Paradox (early form) | "Six weeks at settlement" (lines 2362, 2451). |

### Marcus

| Timeframe | Event | Location | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| Day 0 | Arrives on Dereth | Wilderness | Age 43. |
| ~6 hours | Reaches settlement | Fort Ironwood (pre-existing) | 6 hours walking to find settlement (line 2759). |
| Day 3 (72 hours) | First Olthoi attack | Fort Ironwood | "Olthoi attack 72 hours after arrival" (line 2961). |
| ~3 weeks | First death | Fort Ironwood | "First death 3 weeks into tenure" (line 3121). Resurrection experience becomes tactical data (lines 3204-3217). |
| ~6 weeks | Fort transformation complete | Fort Ironwood | "Fort Ironwood transformation took 6 weeks" (line 3051). Systematic military restructuring. |

| The Seekers (later: The Archive) | Duulak | Research, understanding the Mechanism | Line ~5121 |
| The Transcendent (later: Paradox) | Maajid | Voluntary evolution, consciousness expansion | Line ~5123 |

Structure: Quarterly councils, deadlocked issues resolved through temporal separation, parallel experimentation, or acknowledged irreconcilable difference (lines 5100-5104).

| Targeted dream-messages to each Harbinger | Following nights | In dreams | Lines 6073-6079. Each message precisely targets deepest desire: Marcus's soldier-suffering, Thomas's lost home, Duulak's hunger for answers, Maajid's already plural state. |
| **Council of Harbingers** | Post-ultimatum | Nexus of the Five Towers | "The Council of Harbingers," line 6083-6109. First in-person meeting since schism. |
| Duulak proposes using Asheron | At council | Nexus | Line 6097-6101. "Not as savior. As a knowledge source." |

| Each Harbinger undergoes transformation ritual | Pre-battle period | Nexus chambers | Ch "The Rituals of Becoming." Each transformation is physical, costly, irreversible. |
| Marcus: consciousness distribution | Pre-battle | Nexus | Develops ability to inhabit 5 bodies simultaneously (referenced throughout Vol IV-V; 5 bodies at siege relief, line 5655). |
| Duulak: body becomes translucent | Pre-battle | Nexus | Equations visible beneath skin. Hands translucent (multiple references in Vol IV-V). |
| Thomas: memory absorption | Pre-battle | Nexus | Carries "ten thousand memories, ten thousand griefs" by final battle (line 6632). White hair. |
| Maajid: multi-state existence | Already transformed | Paradox/Nexus | Flickering form, exists in multiple timelines (established in Maajid's Transformation section). |

### The Battle

| Event | Timeframe | Location | Manuscript Location |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Final battle begins** | After preparation | Great Hive / Matriarch's chamber | Ch "Confronting the Matriarch." |
| Battle duration: 7 days, 7 nights | Full battle | Across Dereth and the Hive | "Seven days and seven nights" (line 6439). |

| Marcus engages with 5 distributed bodies | Battle | Matriarch's chamber | Line 6480-6492 area. Coordinated multi-body assault. |
| Duulak's equations destabilize chamber | Battle | Matriarch's chamber | Crystal walls crack. Equations attempt to parse Matriarch's being. |
| Maajid's paradox-waves kill drones | Battle | Matriarch's chamber | Line 6500. "Drones fell dead where the paradox-waves struck them." Each paradox costs him -- form scatters further (line 6502). |
| Matriarch's scream of grief | Turning point | Matriarch's chamber | Line 6509-6511. Not rage or pain but grief. Thomas recognizes it. |
| Matriarch closes around all four | Escalation | Chamber | Line 6513. Chamber contracts. Hive-mind presses against their thoughts. |
| Thomas sees ancient memory in Matriarch's mind | Turning point | Within hive-mind contact | Line 6519-6521. Memory of alien creature watching waves on a lost world. Matriarch kept this memory "the way Thomas turned the carved rabbit in his pocket." |
| **Thomas calls ceasefire** | Pivotal moment | Matriarch's chamber | Line 6524. "Stop. Everyone stop." Quietly, not shouted. |
| Chamber stills | Immediate | Chamber | Line 6527-6529. Marcus lowers weapons. Duulak's equations fade. Maajid draws states closer. |
| Initial negotiation | Hours | Chamber | Lines 6531-6538. Matriarch: "We expand or die." Maajid shows visions of other worlds. |

### The Resolution

| Event | Timeframe | Location | Manuscript Location |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Asheron offers portal solution | Post-ceasefire | Matriarch's chamber | Ch "The Resolution," line 6542-6546. Portals to uninhabited worlds. |
| Thomas confronts Asheron | Immediate | Chamber | Line 6548-6574. Knife to Asheron's throat. "You could always do this." Forces admission of monstrousness. "I won't forgive you." |
| Asheron admits full responsibility | Under blade | Chamber | Line 6561. "I am responsible for every death, every trauma, every loss." |
| Thomas's terms: no redemption for Asheron | Same moment | Chamber | Line 6571. "You don't get to be redeemed." Lowers knife. |
| Detailed negotiation | "Hours" after ceasefire | Chamber | Line 6590. Boundaries, territories, exchange protocols, enforcement. Matriarch: southern continent. Humanity: north and central. 3 uninhabited worlds opened. |
| Near-collapse over scout-drones | During negotiation | Chamber | Line 6592-6613. Matriarch demands observers in human territory. Marcus refuses across 5 bodies. Duulak proposes exchange observers instead: "Individuals. I have not made an individual in a very long time" (line 6609). |
| **Accord signed** | End of negotiation | Chamber | Line 6613. Matriarch agrees to individual observers rather than drones. |
| Harbingers become living treaties | Post-accord | -- | Line 6615. "Neither fully human nor Olthoi but something between." |

### Aftermath / Final Scene

| Character | State | Details | Manuscript Location |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Marcus | Writing first peacetime order | "Not a condolence but an order of the day" (line 6652). 5 distributed bodies. | Line 6618-6619, 6652 |
| Duulak | Weaving accord into reality | Translucent hands. Yasmin's obsidian stone clutched "like a talisman" (line 6626). | Line 6626 |
| Thomas | With Elena | "Three years of impossible war" together (line 6628). White hair. Ten thousand memories. Carved rabbit worn smooth, "details of the ears and tail nearly gone" (line 6644). Virindi exchange: "We still cannot feel what you feel. But we remember now why feeling mattered" (line 6642). Plans to carve another rabbit someday, "for a child here, on Dereth" (line 6648). | Lines 6628-6650 |
| Maajid | Watching, flickering between states | Smells cardamom. States collapse to one person for 3 heartbeats (line 6656). "Just remembering what kitchens smell like" (line 6660). Smiling "in every state, and the smile was the same in all of them" (line 6663). | Lines 6652-6663 |
| Asheron | Diminished, apart | "The weight of Thomas's unforgiveness visible in his posture" (line 6622). | Line 6622 |
| Matriarch | Recedes into crystal depths | "Taking her vast hunger with her" (line 6624). | Line 6624 |

## Character Death Counts (Cumulative)

Tracking death counts as stated in the manuscript.

| Character | Timeframe | Count | Source |
|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Duulak | Day 3 | 1 | Line 684 (first death) |
| Duulak | ~3 months | 2 | "Died twice while researching" (line 3299) |
| Duulak | 6 months | 43 | Line 5141 |
| Thomas | 5 weeks | 10 | Lines 1523-1524 |
| Thomas | ~3 months | ~10 | Duulak's report (line 3282) |
| Thomas | "Months to years" | 17 | Line 5193, confirmed at 2-year convergence (line 5393) |
| Thomas | Siege of Haven | +11 (total unknown) | Line 5651 (11 deaths during siege) |
| Maajid | 3 months | 42 | Lines 2383 (41), 2435 (42nd deliberate) |
| Maajid | At convergence meeting | 47 | Line 3709 |
| Maajid | Transformation ritual | 47 + multiple ritual deaths | 7+ deaths during multi-stone ritual (lines 5995-6013) |
| Marcus | 3 weeks | 1 | Line 3121 (first death) |

**Note:** Thomas's count at 3 months (~10) and at 5 weeks (10) appears to be the same number at slightly different timeframes; the manuscript gives both "ten deaths" at 5 weeks and "approximately ten times in three months" via Duulak's secondhand report. This may indicate Thomas's death rate slowed after the initial 5-week period, or it reflects imprecise secondhand reporting.

## Character Ages

| Character | Age at Arrival | Source |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Duulak | 47 | Line 78 ("forty-seven and brilliant") |
| Thomas | 34 | Line 878 |
| Maajid | 17 | Line 381, repeated line 3557 |
| Marcus | 43 | Line 405 ("forty-three years old, twenty-seven of them in the Legion") |

## Time Differential (Ispar-Dereth)

| Fact | Source |
|------|--------|
| Ratio: ~20:1 (Ispar time passes faster) | Line 4954, Ch "The Ambush" |
| 6 months on Dereth = ~10 years on Ispar | Lines 4966-4968 |
| "Centuries have passed on Ispar" | Asheron, line 5787 (at ~3 years Dereth time = ~60 years Ispar) |
| Families on Ispar are "dust" | Asheron, line 5787 |

## Known Inconsistencies

Items requiring editorial attention:

1. **Thomas's death count at 3 months vs. 5 weeks:** Manuscript gives "ten deaths" at 5 weeks (lines 1523-1524) and "approximately ten times in three months" via Duulak's secondhand trader report (line 3282). Either the 5-week count is the same as the 3-month count (death rate slowed dramatically), or the trader report is imprecise.

2. **Vol I vs. Vol II retelling of Thomas-Virindi first contact:** In Vol I (Ch 3 area), Thomas meets Virindi ~37 days in, already functioning as hunter with Elena nearby. In Vol II ("Thomas's Descent," line 5204), the first Virindi encounter is described as happening "as months turned to years" during a period of suicidal despair. The Vol I version is more temporally specific; the Vol II version may be a second, deeper encounter rather than the literal first contact.

3. **Vol I vs. Vol II retelling of Duulak's discovery:** Vol I, Ch "The Scholar's Recognition" (~3 months) shows Duulak identifying the four-outlier pattern from trader journals. Vol II "Paths of Power" (6 months) shows the portal-selection breakthrough and Harbinger Protocol discovery. These are compatible but could be read as overlapping narratives. The 3-month discovery is the initial pattern recognition; the 6-month discovery is the deeper Protocol understanding.

4. **Gaius's arrival timeline:** In Vol II (line 5278), Gaius is Marcus's lieutenant at Fort Ironwood during the Lucia incident (~6 months). In Vol III (line 5545), he "eventually followed [Marcus] through a portal" -- implying he arrived later, possibly "two years after" Marcus's arrival. But Gaius appears as lieutenant earlier than that 2-year mark. The timeline of Gaius's portal crossing vs. his role as lieutenant may need reconciliation.

5. **Asheron's time revelation location:** The 20:1 ratio is first stated during the convergence meeting area (line 4954), but the "centuries have passed" revelation comes during the ambush at the Nexus (~Year 3, line 5787). If the time differential was revealed at the Month 3-4 convergence meeting, Thomas's reaction at the Year 3 ambush ("The revelation broke something in Thomas," line 5790) suggests he either didn't fully internalize it earlier or the specific detail about families being "dust" is the new, breaking information.
